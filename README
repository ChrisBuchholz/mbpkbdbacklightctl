mbpkbdbacklightctl is program for controlling keyboard backlight on MacBook Pro
When initiated, it  sets the  amount of  backlight to a  default value of 75
but the program can also be called with an argument:

    $ mbpkbdbacklightctl 100

which would set the backlight amount to an  value  of 100  and  the  default
will be set to 100 for this instance of the program
The optional argument must be an integer in the range of 0 to 255

The program will also turn off the keyboard  backlight  if  no keyboard  and
mouse events has occured for at least 20 seconds, and will turn it  back  on
when such event is detected

The program requires libxss to detect idle time of keyboard and mouse events
